My Javascript quiz!
    Think you know javascript? Take my quiz and realy find out!

    My quiz was built functioning mainly with javascript to switch between questions, know your answer choice of being wrong or right and bases on that either awarding you points or deducting time from your timer. You have 60 seconds to complete this quiz of 10 questions and once that is up if you have not yet finished the quiz is over. Once quiz is over you can submit your score into the leaderboard to keep track of your scores everytime you take the quiz.
